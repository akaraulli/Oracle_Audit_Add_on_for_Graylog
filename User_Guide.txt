1. OVERVIEW

Oracle Audit Add-on for Graylog integrates Oracle unified audit with Graylog system.

1.1 Architecture

| Oracle Database -> Oracle Audit Add-on for Graylog | -> | Graylog GELF TCP Input -> Graylog |

Oracle Audit Add-on for Graylog is an Oracle software package that performs delivery of Oracle 
unified audit events to Graylog SIEM system. The delivery is performed via TCP protocol. An Oracle
scheduler job invokes periodically the procedure that collects the latest events and delivers them 
in JSON format for Graylog GELF. On Graylog side a GELF TCP Input receives and ingests the Oracle 
unified audit events to Graylog repository.


1.2 Compatibility

Oracle database support:

Oracle versions 12c, 18c, 19c and 21c

Graylog support:

Graylog versions 2, 3 and 4


2. SETUP

2.1 Install Requirements

Permissions:

SYS/SYSDBA permissions are required for the install.

Optional Index:

Depending on the volume and purge policies of Oracle unified audit, an index may be required on the 
Oracle table AUD$UNIFIED that stores records presented by Oracle system view UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL. 
To create the index, set the <tablespace_name> according to your environment, and execute the 
following SQL command:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
create index EVENT_TIMESTAMP_IDX on AUDSYS.AUD$UNIFIED (event_timestamp) tablespace <tablespace_name>;
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


2.2 Install

Log on as SYS/SYSDBA. 
On the SQL> terminal run the install script Ora_Aud_GrayLog_[v]_[r]_[m]_Install.sql (1).
After install check the generated log file Ora_Aud_GrayLog_[v]_[r]_[m]_Install.log.

(1) [v]_[r]_[m] stands for [version]_[release]_[maintenance/patch]

Install will create an Oracle user AUDORAGRAYLOG, with the following objects:

LMS_PARAM		Table of operations parameters
LMS_SRV			Table of Graylog server settings
ORACLE_GRAYLOG		Main software package. Procedure LMS_GRAYLOG inside performs the delivery
LMS_GRAYLOG		Scheduler job that invokes the LMS_GRAYLOG procedure

Confirm the (VALID) status of Add-on objects on system view DBA_OBJECTS!


2.3 Graylog Server Settings

Graylog server settings are persisted on a single record of table LMS_SRV. 

Table fields are:

LMS_ID		Id of Graylog server. The single record has a value of 1  	
DB_NAME		Database common short name. Oracle system context DB_NAME when unset (1) 
DB_FULL_NAME	Database common full name. Oracle system context DB_UNIQUE_NAME when unset 
LMS_HOST	Graylog server hostname or IP address
LMS_PORT	Graylog server port (2) 
LMS_HOST_2	Graylog second server - reserved for future use
LMS_PORT_2	Graylog second server port - reserved for future use
LMS_CHARSET	Character set for delivery, default AL32UTF8 
TIMESTAMP_LST	Persisted last value of the "Rising Column" EVENT_TIMESTAMP
MAX_ROWS	Maximum number of rows delivered. Default 10000 

(1) Asterisk (*) indicates an unset value
(2) Must match the port of Graylog GELF TCP Input running on Graylog machine

As a minimum you must set the Graylog server hostname/IP and port. Replace <Graylog hostname/IP> 
with the hostname or IP address of your Graylog server, accept/change the port of GELF TCP Input,
and execute the following SQL command:

----------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_SRV set
lms_host = '<Graylog hostname/IP>',
lms_port = <port>
where lms_id = 1;
----------------------------------

For example:

----------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_SRV set
lms_host = 'mygrayloghostname',
lms_port = 41001
where lms_id = 1;
----------------------------------

Note:
To ensure multi-DB support on Graylog side keep the DB_NAME unique in your Oracle environment. It 
is recommended that DB_FULL_NAME is also kept unique. If your Oracle environment does not offer 
this (same DB name in more than one database), then avoid duplication by setting them manually.

To set DB naming fields, execute the following SQL command:

-----------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_SRV set
db_name	= 'myoracledb',
db_full_name = 'My Oracle Database'
where lms_id = 1;
-----------------------------------


2.4 Oracle Network Access Lists (ACL)

ACL access is mandatory since Oracle 11 for every user other then SYS. Without this necessary 
access, the following error will occur:

ORA-24247: network access denied by access control list (ACL)

The commands for creating, revoking and viewing network ACL access are provided in file ACL.txt.
Create the required access toward the Graylog server machine before starting.


2.5 Oracle Application Schemas 

The dataset of audit events delivered to Oracle contains extra fields other than those of the 
unified audit trail system view - refer to topic No 3.!

To highlight any event related to objects of your Oracle applications (SEO_APP=1) the application
schema owner[s] must be declared in this Add-on. This single value, or entries list, is persisted 
on table LMS_PARAM, VALUE field of the parameter coded APPSCHM and named "Application Schemas". 
When not in use (default on deploy) the diesis (#) character is set.

To declare your application schema[s], execute the following SQL command:

------------------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_PARAM set
param_value = '<Oracle applications list>'
where parameter_id = 1;
------------------------------------------

For example, for a single application user schema named MYAPP, execute the following SQL command:

----------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_PARAM set
param_value = 'MYAPP'
where parameter_id = 1;
----------------------------------

For multiple application schemas, the diesis (#) character must be used as a separator. For example,
in case of three schemas named MYAPP1, MYAPP2 and MYAPP1, execute the following SQL command:

------------------------------------
update AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_PARAM set
param_value = 'MYAPP1#MYAPP2#MYAPP3'
where parameter_id = 1;
------------------------------------


2.6 Start audit events delivery

Oracle Scheduler job LMS_GRAYLOG performs periodical delivery of Oracle unified audit events to Graylog. 
By default the Scheduler job is not enabled on install. 

After completing the previous steps above, start the delivery of audit events by enabling the Scheduler Job.
Refer to topic 4.3 Scheduler job control!

Note:
Default run interval of this job is 60 seconds.

Monitor job activity in Oracle system view DBA_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS!


2.7 Uninstall

Log on as SYS/SYSDBA. 
On the SQL> terminal run the uninstall script Ora_Aud_GrayLog_[v]_[r]_[m]_Uninstall.sql (1).
After install check the generated log file Ora_Aud_GrayLog_[v]_[r]_[m]_Uninstall.log.

(1) [v]_[r]_[m] stands for [version]_[release]_[maintenance/patch]


3. Audit Events Dataset for Graylog

3.1 Field Types

* DB common naming fields and DB hostname (1)
* Oracle system view UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL fields (2)
* Search Extra Options (SEO) fields

(1) Oracle system context SERVER_HOST
(2) Fields OBJECT_TYPE and DP_WARNINGS1, introduced in Oracle 21c, are commented in the LMS_GRAYLOG
procedure to avoid error in Oracle versions 12c, 18c and 19c. To use these fields in Oracle 21c, 
uncomment their declarations on both cursor fields and Graylog JSON record construction.


3.2 Search Extra Options (SEO) fields

Logical 0/1 (false/true) fields define extra categorization of unified audit events.

SEO_SEC		Security events
SEO_ACC		Logon access events
SEO_ORA		Oracle (SYS-owned) objects events
SEO_DDL		Data definition events
SEO_DML		Data manipulation events
SEO_SE		Select, Execute and Read events
SEO_ERR		Error events
SEO_APP		Application schemas events
SEO_CURR_USER	Top-SQL execution event

These fields are transformed from combinations of unified audit event field values for each record
and are used to simplify searching, reporting and alerting on the Graylog system.


4. OPERATIONS

4.1 Normal Operations

The scheduler job LMS_GRAYLOG will invoke the ORACLE_GRAYLOG.LMS_GRAYLOG procedure. This procedure 
will query the latest events of system view UNIFIED_AUDIT_TRAIL . "Latest" is defined as records 
having an EVENT_TIMESTAMP value greater then what is persisted on the prior run in TIMESTAMP_LST 
column of single-record table LMS_SRV. These events will be delivered to Graylog, persisting the 
greatest EVENT_TIMESTAMP value of the processed events that will serve as a starting point for the 
next procedure run.

Key columns in the process are:

EVENT_TIMESTAMP		rising column for events
EVENT_TIMESTAMP_UTC	timestamp column for Graylog events

In the delivered GELF JSON package the timestamp column is formatted as an Unix epoch time with 
fractional seconds. 

On the first run, the empty (on install) value of table LMS_SRV column TIMESTAMP_LST will be set 
with the current timestamp of the database system. To start collection of audit events from a time
prior to current, set this value manually in the LMS_SRV table.


4.2 Diagnostics and Debug

Diagnostics:

select * from dba_objects t
where t.owner = 'AUDORAGRAYLOG'

select * from dba_scheduler_jobs t
where t.owner = 'AUDORAGRAYLOG'
and t.job_name = 'LMS_GRAYLOG'

select * from dba_scheduler_job_run_details t
where t.owner = 'AUDORAGRAYLOG'
and t.job_name = 'LMS_GRAYLOG'
order by t.log_id

select * from unified_audit_trail t
where t.event_timestamp > systimestamp -1
order by t.event_timestamp 

select 
lms_host, lms_port, lms_charset, timestamp_lst, max_rows
from AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_SRV


Debug:

Use the Oracle's DBMS_OUTPUT to debug operations of the Add-on, ex. the event's GELF JSON pack 
delivered to Graylog. Dbms_Output is commented in code on a single instance as an illustration;
user can add others at will. 

Debug info is found on Oracle view DBA_SCHEDULER_JOB_RUN_DETAILS, fields OUTPUT and BINARY_OUTPUT. 

Eventual error info is be found on Oracle view dba_scheduler_job_run_details, fields 
ADDITIONAL_INFO, ERRORS, BINARY_ERRORS.


4.3 Scheduler job control

To enable the job run:

begin
 dbms_scheduler.enable(
 'AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_GRAYLOG'
 );  
end;
/

To disable the job run:

begin
 dbms_scheduler.disable(
 'AUDORAGRAYLOG.LMS_GRAYLOG',
 TRUE
 );  
end;
/


5. Graylog minimal requirements

5.1 GELF TCP Input

Minimal requirement on the Graylog system is a running GELF TCP Input. The port of this input must 
match the one declared in field LMS_PORT of table LMS_SRV


5.2 Application search

The GELF JSON package contains a special field, application_name, which is set as "oraaudgraylog".
To identify this Add-on events from events of other systems/application in Graylog, start your
searches with:

application_name:oraaudgraylog
